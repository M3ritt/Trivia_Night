# Trivia_Night
This was a fun little idea I had because since COVID started, 
I haven't been able to go out to trivia nights. 
This is a work in progress on what I want it to eventually be. 

Currently, this program only has a text-based mode of doing head-to-head trivia against a few 
other players. The first player to reach a certain amount 
of points, one per category, wins by going on a turn-by-turn basis. 

More specifics of the game include:
 
- If a Player gets a question right or 3 questions wrong within the same category: 
 that player no longer has access to it. Additionally, 
 a Player can be kicked from the game if they can no longer win. 
 
- Each Player has a set amount of time to answer a question, if they take too long then 
 the answer is considered incorrect and cannot get that question again.
